# Welcome to the Cardinal Gibbons NC GPA Calculator!
## I made this for myself, but I'm publishing this to GitHub because I know others who want a quick and easy way to get their Gibbons GPA.
### How to use:
1. Go to the GitHubPages link you will see on the right side of this repository's home screen, or go to the url provided.
2. if you went with the first route, then click on the current page seen at the top of your screen. 
3. Now you should be on the webpage
#### For the Semester GPA Calculator:
4. Fill in your classes --they should autofill and add the proper grading type (if it doesn't reach out ot me to fixt it)
5. Put in your grades for each class with the dropdown then hit "Get GPA"
6. Congrats! those are your two GPA's -- your weighted and your unweighted

### TERMS:
#### This is not an official site from Cardinal Gibbons North Carolina High School, this is a site made purely by a student and for students. This site only uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; your GPA is safe with you. If you experience any bugs, please email me at NoahBoussi@gmail.com or my school email (I won't list that here, for this page is public). If you have any further questions, concerns, or requests, email me there-- I won't charge to add more Gibbons tools. Just ask!
